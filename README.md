<h1> Our First Project </h1>

This project uses 3 LEDs on a breadboard to indicate which color scratchy has to go to.

Needed:
* Raspberry Pi
* breadboard
* T-Shaped connector
* Ribbon cable
* 3 LED (red, green and blue)
* three 220 ohms resistors
* three male-to-male cables

The Game
=========
The game is very simple. One of the lights will turn on or no lights turns on. You have 3 seconds to take scratchy to the right color block. If the scratchy gets to the right block, one point is scored or if time is up, he looses one life. After three lives, the game is over.
